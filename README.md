# Django and PostgreSQL sample for Azure App Service

This is a sample application that you can use to follow along with the tutorial at 
[Build a Python and PostgreSQL web app in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/containers/tutorial-python-postgresql-app). 

The sample is a simple Python Django application that connects to a PostgreSQL database.

The database connection information is specified via environment variables `DBHOST`, `DBPASS`, `DBUSER`, and `DBNAME`. This app always uses the default PostgreSQL port.

**BREAKING CHANGE Oct 12 2020**: The `DBHOST` environment variable is expected to contain *only* the server name, not the full URL, which is constructed at run time (see azuresite/production.py). Similarly, `DBUSER` is expected to contain only the user name, not username@servername as before, because using the simpler `DBHOST` the code can also construct the correct login form at run time (again in azuresite/production.py), avoiding failures that arise when `DBUSER` lacks the @servername portion.
